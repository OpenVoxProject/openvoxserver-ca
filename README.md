# OpenVox Server's CA CLI Library

This gem provides the functionality behind the OpenVox Server CA interactions.
The actual CLI executable lives within the OpenVox Server project.
This is a community implementation of the `puppetserver-ca` gem. 


## Installation

You may install it yourself with:

    $ gem install openvoxserver-ca


## Usage

For initial CA setup, we provide two options. These need to be run before starting
Puppet Server for the first time.

To set up a default CA, with a self-signed root cert and an intermediate signing cert:
```
puppetserver ca setup
```

To import a custom CA:
```
puppetserver ca import --cert-bundle certs.pem --crl-chain crls.pem --private-key ca_key.pem
```

The remaining actions provided by this gem require a running OpenVox Server (Puppet Server), since
it primarily uses the CA's API endpoints to do its work. The following examples
assume that you are using the gem packaged within OpenVox Server.

To sign a pending certificate request:
```
puppetserver ca sign --certname foo.example.com
```

To list certificates and CSRs:
```
puppetserver ca list --all
```

To revoke a signed certificate:
```
puppetserver ca revoke --certname foo.example.com
```

To revoke the cert and clean up all SSL files for a given certname:
```
puppetserver ca clean --certname foo.example.com
```

To create a new keypair and certificate for a certname:
```
puppetserver ca generate --certname foo.example.com
```

To remove duplicated entries from Puppet's CRL:
```
puppetserver ca prune
```

To enable verbose mode:
```
puppetserver ca --verbose <action>
```

For more details, see the help output:
```
puppetserver ca --help
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then,
run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an
interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

### Testing
To test your changes on a VM:
1. Build the gem with your changes: `gem build openvoxserver-ca.gemspec`
1. Copy the gem to your VM: `scp openvoxserver-ca-<version>.gem <your-vm>:.`
1. Install openvox-server by installing the relevant release package and then installing the openvox-server package. For example:
    ```
    $ wget https://yum.voxpupuli.org/openvox8-release-el-9.noarch.rpm
    $ rpm -i openvox8-release-el-9.noarch.rpm
    $ yum update
    $ yum install -y openvox-server
    ```
1. Restart your shell so that puppet's bin dir is on your $PATH: `exec bash`
1. Install the gem into puppet's gem directory using puppet's gem command:
    ```
    $ /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install --install-dir "/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/lib/ruby/vendor_gems" openvoxserver-ca-<version>.gem
    ```
1. To confirm that installation was successful, run `puppetserver ca --help`
